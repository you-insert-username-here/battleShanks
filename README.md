COSC101 - Battle Tanks - Assignment 2

Instructions:
 - Create a new sketch.
 - Add a new tab for each of the .pde's that are in this git repository
 - Copy tab code to corresponding tab in Processing
 - Run sketch

If you are going to make changes to the code, try to make a pull request rather than a hard commit.
In Slack give a basic outline of code/features added and ask for a pull request.

Ideally we want to check functionality before every commit.
